The time has finally come! We've laid all the groundwork to understand the nuts and bolts behind UI testing, now it's time to do some!

To start off, we're going to create a new folder for all of our project to go in. Later on, we'll be incorporating this project into a fully-fledged application repo, but for now we'll create an individual WebdriverIO project.

So, in a directory of your choice, make a new folder called `wdio-tests`:

```
mkdir wdio-tests
```

Alternatively on Windows:

```
TODO wdio-tests
```

We then need to 'move' our terminal into that folder:

```
cd wdio-tests
```

(For Windows, it's the same command)

Inside our new folder, we're going to initialize it as an NPM project. This will allow us to save the project dependencies that we'll be installing through NPM.

To do that, run:

```
npm init -y
```

The `-y` will answer 'yes' to all the prompts, giving us a standard NPM project. Feel free to omit the `-y` if you'd like to specify your project details.

With that out of the way, let's install WebdriverIO:

```
npm install webdriverio
```

Now is a good time to mention that WebdriverIO is split into multiple NPM packages. We'll be looking at those packages in detail later on, but know for now that installing `webdriverio` via the command above does not give you everything.

What it does give us is a Node.js module that we can use inside of a Node.js file. Let's use that.

First, we'll create a new file called 'test.js`:

```
touch test.js
```
 
On Windows, that command is:

```
type nul > test.js
```

Now we have a file to add our first test to. Go ahead and open that file up in the text editor of your choice.

Next, we'll copy the example given on the official WebdriverIO website. Throw the following code into your `test.js` file:

```js
const { remote } = require('webdriverio');

(async () => {
    const browser = await remote({
        capabilities: {
            browserName: 'chrome'
        }
    });

    await browser.url('https://webdriver.io');

    const title = await browser.getTitle();
    console.log('Title was: ' + title);

    await browser.deleteSession();
})().catch((e) => console.error(e));
```

We'll go through this code line by line in just a moment, but first, let's run it to see it in action.

To do that, we need to start a Webdriver server. This server will accept the commands sent from WebdriverIO, run them in our desired browser, then report back the results. 

In "Browsers and 'Driving' Them", I detailed how to install and run Chromedriver and the selenium-standalone NPM package. Now let's put that knowledge to use.

First, we'll start with selenium-standlone. If you already have your server running from before, great! You don't need to do anything else.

But if not, open up a new terminal window and run `selenium-standalone start`. 

Aside from seeing the server running in your terminal, you can check that you have a Selenium instance up and running by visiting the following url in your browser: http://localhost:4444/wd/hub

You should see a website looking a lot like this:

If you get a 404 error, something went wrong starting your server, and you'll need further debugging to resolve it.

Now that we have a selenium server running, we can run our test.
